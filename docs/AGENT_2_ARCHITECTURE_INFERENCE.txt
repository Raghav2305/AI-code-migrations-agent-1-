DETAILED WORKFLOW:
==================

STEP 1: DETECT ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS (AI-POWERED)
--------------------------------------------------
Function: detectArchitecturePatterns()
Location: line 34

What it does:
- Creates comprehensive file structure JSON for AI analysis
- Uses AI (Gemini) to detect sophisticated architectural patterns
- Falls back to rule-based pattern matching if AI fails
- Provides pattern confidence levels and evidence reasoning

AI Pattern Detection Process:
1. Transforms file structure into hierarchical JSON with architectural indicators
2. Sends structured prompt to Gemini AI model for pattern analysis
3. Receives detailed pattern analysis with confidence levels and evidence
4. Falls back to rule-based detection if AI analysis fails

AI Prompt Structure:
- Repository context (name, language, description, project type)
- Detailed file structure with directory purposes and file organization
- Analysis criteria focusing on naming conventions and architectural indicators
- Request for pattern identification with confidence levels and evidence

AI Response Format:
{
  "detectedPatterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "MVC (Model-View-Controller)",
      "confidence": "high",
      "evidence": ["controllers/ directory", "models/ directory", "views/ directory"],
      "description": "Clear separation of concerns with dedicated MVC directories"
    }
  ],
  "primaryArchitecture": "Layered Architecture",
  "architecturalStyle": "Traditional three-tier web application",
  "reasoning": "Evidence-based explanation of architectural classification"
}

Pattern Detection Rules:

MVC (Model-View-Controller):
- Checks for files/folders containing: "controller", "model", "view"
- Requires all three components to be present
- Example: src/controllers/, src/models/, src/views/

Layered Architecture:
- Looks for: "service", "repository", "dao", "business", "data"
- Indicates separation of concerns in layers
- Example: src/services/, src/repositories/

Microservices:
- Detects: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, kubernetes manifests
- Multiple service directories with independent deployments
- Example: services/user-service/, services/payment-service/

Component-Based:
- Finds: "component", "module" in file/folder names
- Common in React, Angular, Vue applications
- Example: src/components/, src/modules/

Domain-Driven Design:
- Searches for: "domain", "aggregate", "entity", "valueobject"
- Business-focused folder organization
- Example: src/domains/user/, src/domains/order/

Hexagonal/Clean Architecture:
- Identifies: "adapter", "port", "core", "infrastructure"
- Dependency inversion patterns
- Example: src/adapters/, src/ports/, src/core/

Example Pattern Detection Results:
[
  "MVC",
  "Layered", 
  "Component-Based"
]

STEP 2: ANALYZE TECH STACK
---------------------------
Function: analyzeTechStack()
Location: line 61

What it does:
- Parses dependency and configuration files to extract technology information
- Uses file extension analysis to determine programming languages
- Identifies frameworks, libraries, databases, and build tools
- Creates comprehensive technology stack profile

Technology Detection Sources:

package.json (Node.js/JavaScript):
- Dependencies: react, express, lodash, axios
- DevDependencies: webpack, jest, typescript, eslint
- Scripts: build commands, test runners
- Engines: Node.js version requirements

pom.xml (Java/Maven):
- Dependencies: spring-boot, hibernate, junit
- Plugins: maven-compiler-plugin, surefire
- Properties: Java version, encoding

requirements.txt (Python):
- Packages: django, flask, fastapi, pytest
- Version constraints: django>=3.2,<4.0

Gemfile (Ruby):
- Gems: rails, sinatra, rspec, capybara
- Ruby version specification

Cargo.toml (Rust):
- Dependencies: actix-web, tokio, serde
- Build configuration

composer.json (PHP):
- Dependencies: laravel, symfony, phpunit
- Platform requirements

go.mod (Go):
- Module dependencies
- Go version requirements

File Extension Analysis:
- Counts files by extension (.js, .py, .java, etc.)
- Determines primary and secondary languages
- Calculates language distribution percentages

Example Tech Stack Result:
{
  "language": "JavaScript",
  "frameworks": ["React", "Express.js", "Next.js"],
  "libraries": ["Lodash", "Axios", "Moment.js"],
  "databases": ["MongoDB", "Redis"],
  "tools": ["Webpack", "Jest", "ESLint", "TypeScript"],
  "buildSystem": "npm",
  "packageManager": "npm"
}

STEP 3: INFER COMPONENTS
------------------------
Function: inferComponents()
Location: line 88

What it does:
- Groups related files into logical components
- Analyzes directory structure to identify cohesive modules
- Determines component types and relationships
- Maps dependencies between components

Component Identification Logic:

Directory-Based Grouping:
- Groups files by their directory structure
- Each directory becomes a potential component
- Excludes system directories (node_modules, .git, dist)

Component Type Classification:
- Controller: Contains "controller", "handler", "route"
- Service: Contains "service", "business", "logic"  
- Model: Contains "model", "entity", "schema"
- Utility: Contains "util", "helper", "common"
- Config: Contains "config", "settings", "env"

File Analysis:
- Looks at file naming patterns
- Analyzes import/require statements (if available)
- Considers file size and complexity

Example Component Results:
[
  {
    "name": "user-management",
    "type": "service",
    "files": [
      "src/user-management/UserService.js",
      "src/user-management/UserController.js", 
      "src/user-management/UserModel.js"
    ],
    "dependencies": ["authentication", "database"]
  },
  {
    "name": "authentication",
    "type": "utility",
    "files": [
      "src/auth/AuthService.js",
      "src/auth/TokenManager.js"
    ],
    "dependencies": ["config"]
  }
]

STEP 4: IDENTIFY ENTRY POINTS
------------------------------
Function: identifyEntryPoints()
Location: line 569

What it does:
- Finds main application entry points
- Classifies entry point types (main, API, CLI, web)
- Provides descriptions for each entry point

Entry Point Patterns:
- main.*: Primary application entry
- index.*: Module or package entry points
- app.*: Application bootstrap files
- server.*: Server/API entry points
- cli.*: Command-line interface entry
- bin/*: Executable scripts

Example Entry Points:
[
  {
    "file": "src/index.js",
    "type": "main",
    "description": "Main application entry point"
  },
  {
    "file": "src/server.js", 
    "type": "api",
    "description": "API server entry point"
  }
]

STEP 5: GENERATE ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS
---------------------------------------
Function: generateArchitectureAnalysis()
Location: line 117

What it does:
- Combines all previous analysis into comprehensive AI prompt
- Sends detailed architectural information to AI model
- Requests structured analysis with specific architectural insights
- Implements fallback for complex repositories

AI MODEL CALLS:
