# Activity Log - AI-Assisted Legacy Migration Agent Suite

## 2025-07-16

### Project Setup
- Created CLAUDE.md with project configuration and commands
- Created ACTIVITY_LOG.md to track development progress
- Analyzed existing project structure (summary.txt and Word document)
- Planning repository structure for agent suite

### Current Status
- Project is in initial setup phase
- GitHub Repo Analyzer Agent marked as completed in summary.txt
- Next focus: Architecture Inference Agent implementation

### Next Steps
1. Define detailed repository structure
2. Set up development environment
3. Design and implement GitHub Repo Analyzer Agent
4. Design and implement Architecture Inference Agent

### Notes
- Project aims to create 8 different agents for legacy migration
- Each agent will have specific inputs/outputs as defined in summary.txt
- Browser extension integration planned for GitHub pages

## Implementation Started - Focus on First 2 Agents

### Scope Decision
- Focus only on Agent 1 (GitHub Repo Analyzer) and Agent 2 (Architecture Inference)
- Build complete end-to-end functionality with UI for manual testing
- Use Gemini API as primary LLM provider
- Implement LangGraph workflows for agent orchestration

### Project Setup Progress
- Created npm project with TypeScript configuration
- Fixed LangChain dependency version conflicts (@langchain/core@^0.3.58)
- Fixed LangGraph package name (@langchain/langgraph instead of langgraph)
- Set up basic project structure with src/ directories
- Created configuration files (tsconfig.json, jest.config.js, .gitignore)
- Implemented shared types and utilities (GitHub client, LLM client, file utils, logger)
- Built GitHub Repo Analyzer Agent (Agent 1) with LangGraph workflow
- Fixed LangGraph workflow edges and TypeScript type issues
- Simplified workflow to sequential execution, resolved content undefined errors
- Built Architecture Inference Agent (Agent 2) with pattern detection and tech stack analysis
- Created REST API with endpoints for analysis, status tracking, and real-time updates
- Implemented main application entry point with environment validation
- Created interactive web UI with real-time progress tracking and tabbed results
- Added static file serving to API and completed full-stack implementation
- Created comprehensive README with usage instructions and testing guide
- Fixed TypeScript compilation error: removed duplicate logWarn export
- Fixed API route handlers: added explicit return statements for TypeScript strict mode
- Fixed cross-origin API calls: updated HTML to use correct API endpoint (localhost:3000)
- Updated LLM client to use Gemini 2.5 Flash model (gemini-2.5-flash) for better performance and cost efficiency
