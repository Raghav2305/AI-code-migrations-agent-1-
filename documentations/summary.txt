AI-Assisted Legacy Migration Agent Suite

Current Progress

You have successfully built the GitHub Repo Analyzer Agent. This agent:
- Automatically triggers on GitHub repo pages
- Summarizes the repository purpose using an LLM
- Extracts and categorizes file structure
- Provides a styled and interactive UI with copy/download features

Next Agent: Architecture Inference Agent

Purpose: Infer high-level architecture of the repo.

Input:
- Output from Repo Analyzer Agent
- Raw code/config files (optional)

Output:
- Architecture type (e.g., monolith, layered, microservice)
- Stack used (e.g., Java + Spring Boot)
- Layers/components inferred
- Entry points (e.g., /login, /register)

Sample Output:
{
'architecture': 'Spring Boot monolith',
'layers': ['Controller', 'Service', 'Repository'],
'tech_stack': ['Java', 'Spring Boot', 'JPA']
}


Future Agents (Roadmap)

3. Code Flow Agent
Purpose:
Understand the logical flow of the application — from user input to system output.
Input:
•	Categorized source code files (from the GitHub Parser Agent).
•	Specific entry point file (e.g., main.java, app.py, etc.).
Output:
•	Step-by-step trace of how data flows through the codebase.
•	Key classes, methods, and their interaction sequence.
Sample:
yaml
CopyEdit
Input: GET /user/profile  
→ Router → AuthMiddleware → UserController → UserService → UserRepository → DB
Use Cases:
•	Identify tightly coupled logic.
•	Understand dependencies and flow for migration planning.

4. Risk Assessment Agent
Purpose:
Detect potentially risky or fragile parts of the code that may break during modernization.
Input:
•	Parsed repo structure
•	Dependency and usage metrics (e.g., frequency of file edits, LOC, cyclomatic complexity).
Output:
•	Heatmap-style risk report highlighting:
o	Outdated libraries
o	Large or complex files
o	Deprecated APIs
Sample:
json
CopyEdit
{
  "high_risk": [
    "UserService.java",
    "AppConfig.java",
    "pom.xml (uses log4j 1.x)"
  ],
  "medium_risk": ["AuthController.java"],
  "low_risk": ["README.md"]
}
Use Cases:
•	Prioritize parts of the system for refactoring.
•	Flag migration blockers early.

5. Migration Strategy Generator
Purpose:
Generate an initial draft of how to split or refactor the monolithic application.
Input:
•	Code flow mapping
•	Risk report
•	Business context tags (optional)
Output:
•	Microservice candidates
•	Suggested API boundaries
•	Communication method (REST/gRPC/events)
•	Potential deployment suggestions (container, serverless, etc.)
Sample:
yaml
CopyEdit
Microservices:
- UserService
- AuthService
- NotificationService

Boundaries:
- Extract NotificationService from UserService (low coupling)
- Separate AuthService due to high call frequency

Recommended:
- Deploy using Docker + K8s
- Communication via REST

6. Stack Upgrade Agent
Purpose:
Modernize the tech stack and suggest newer alternatives.
Input:
•	Detected dependencies from pom.xml, package.json, etc.
Output:
•	Table of outdated libraries/frameworks
•	Recommended upgrades
•	Compatibility notes
Sample:
markdown
CopyEdit
| Current | Latest | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Spring 4.3 | Spring Boot 3.x | Major upgrade required |
| Log4j 1.2 | Logback | Security risk: must upgrade |
| Java 8 | Java 17 | Performance & security |

7. Human Feedback Integrator
Purpose:
Allow humans to interactively review, edit, and approve each AI-generated suggestion.
Input:
•	Suggestions from previous agents
•	Admin/editor responses
Output:
•	JSON/Markdown record of approved, rejected, or modified items
•	Tracked rationale (optional)
Sample:
json
CopyEdit
{
  "AuthService Split": "approved",
  "Upgrade Java 8 to 17": "approved",
  "Move all controllers to API Gateway": "rejected",
  "Extract PDFService": "modified → Merge into DocumentService"
}
Use Cases:
•	Enable collaboration with domain experts.
•	Ensure AI proposals align with business needs.

8. Blueprint Generator
Purpose:
Generate the final migration blueprint as a structured, exportable document.
Input:
•	Aggregated and finalized outputs from all other agents
•	Human-reviewed feedback
Output:
•	Downloadable .md or .pdf file
•	Clear migration plan with steps, diagrams (optional), service breakdowns
Sample TOC (Markdown/PDF):

Agent Integration Vision
Each agent acts in a pipeline:
- GitHub Parser -> Architecture Agent -> Code Flow Agent -> ...
- Human can inspect/edit results at each step
- Final product: a complete, semi-automated legacy migration blueprint
